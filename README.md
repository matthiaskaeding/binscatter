# Modern binscatter plots

* This package implements binscatter plots following Cattaneo, Crump, Farrell and Feng (2024) "On Binscatter" published in the American Economic Review (114:5, pp. 1488-1514, DOI: 10.1257/aer.20221576) 
* Uses ``polars`` for scalability and ``plotnine`` as graphics backend - allowing composable plots
